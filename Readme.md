## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS Transformations
    -   `transform: translate();`
    -   `transform: rotate();`
    -   `transform-origin: top right;`
-   OOP in JavaScript
    -   **SOLID principles**
    -   **classes** and **objects**
-   Performance reliant animations - `requestAnimationFrame(callback);`

### What I learned

-   Prototyping and inheritance of classes in JavaScript
-   Using **SOLID principles**
-   Using `requestAnimationFrame()` window method to create animation loops
-   Using CSS transformations to create a circular clock interface - Math for the positioning of ticks and hour numbers in the circular clock
